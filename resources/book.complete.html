    <h1>In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group
      that can survive the failures of some of its members. Because of this, they
      play a key role in building reliable large-scale software systems. Paxos [15,
      16] has dominated the discussion of consensus algorithms over the last decade:
      most implementations of consensus are based on Paxos or influenced by it, and
      Paxos has become the primary vehicle used to teach students about consensus.
    </p>


    <p>
      Unfortunately, Paxos is quite difficult to understand, in spite of numerous attempts
      to make it more approachable. Furthermore, its architecture requires complex
      changes to support practical systems. As a result, both system builders and
      students struggle with Paxos. After struggling with Paxos ourselves, we set
      out to find a new consensus algorithm that could provide a better foundation
      for system building and education. Our approach was unusual in that our primary
      goal was understandability: could we define a consensus algorithm for practical
      systems and describe it in a way that is signifi- cantly easier to learn than
      Paxos? Furthermore, we wanted the algorithm to facilitate the development of
      intuitions that are essential for system builders. It was important not just
      for the algorithm to work, but for it to be obvious why it works

      algorithm manages a replicated log containing state
      machine commands from clients. The state machines process
      identical sequences of commands from the logs, so they produce
      the same outputs
